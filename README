Git remote helper (http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote-helpers.html) 
for StarTeam. This remote helper allows Git to interact with remote StarTeam 
repositories. The fetch and push commands are based on the Git 
fast-import (http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fast-import.html) 
and fast-export (http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fast-export.html) 
protocols.

-----------
Compilation
-----------
To build the project you need at least Java SDK 7 and Ant.

    Ant
    ---
    To build with Ant just cd to the project root directory and type ant. 
    If the build succeeded you will find distribution zip archive in the 
    distribs directory.

    Make
    ----
    To build with make you need to put Git sources into the 
    <project root directory>/git and type make && make install PREFIX=/usr. 
    For the list of the build dependencies please refer to the debian/control file.

    Pbuilder
    --------
    In the project root directory you can find build.sh script which can be used
    to build deb packages for one of multiple target platforms using pbuilder.

------------
Installation
------------
Extract the built zip archive into the $LIBEXEC/git-core directory. The location
of the LIBEXEC directory depends on the system 
(usually either /usr/lib or /usr/libexec). 
Debian package can be installed with the dpkg -i <name>.deb command.
